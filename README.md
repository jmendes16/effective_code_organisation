# effective_code_organisation
Code, notebooks and instructions for Effective Code Organisation event


## Setup
You will need a Supabase account, with a fresh project.  Instruction for accessing 
connection details are in the pipeline_functions.ipynb notebook.  
You will also need an IDE that will open Jupyter Notebbooks.  
In the demo I use JupyterLab in an anaconda environment and VS code.  

It is intended that you start in the notebook before moving the python files.  
There are gaps for you to fill in (which can be done in the session as a code-a-long).  
There are also solutions provided.
